### **Lung Cancer Diagnosis Dashboard**  

The **Lung Cancer Diagnosis Dashboard** is an advanced analytical platform designed to assist medical professionals, researchers, and healthcare policymakers in detecting, diagnosing, and analyzing lung cancer cases. It leverages machine learning, medical imaging, and real-time patient data to enhance early detection and treatment planning.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Patient Data Analysis:** Aggregates and analyzes patient demographics, symptoms, and medical history.  
- **Medical Imaging Insights:** Integrates CT scan and X-ray analysis using AI-based image processing.  
- **Risk Factor Assessment:** Evaluates genetic, environmental, and lifestyle risk factors associated with lung cancer.  
- **Early Detection Alerts:** Uses machine learning models to predict cancer stages and highlight high-risk cases.  
- **Treatment & Survival Rate Analysis:** Tracks effectiveness of various treatment plans and survival statistics.  
- **Interactive Visualization & Reports:** Provides graphical representation of case trends, diagnostic accuracy, and hospital-wise statistics.  

### **Use Cases:**  
- **Doctors & Radiologists:** Assists in diagnosing lung cancer using AI-powered imaging and data analytics.  
- **Medical Researchers:** Provides insights into trends, risk factors, and treatment effectiveness.  
- **Healthcare Policymakers:** Helps in planning cancer awareness programs and resource allocation.  

This dashboard can be built using **React.js, Python (Flask/Django), TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI models, and databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL**, integrating medical records, imaging datasets, and hospital data to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

TOOLS USED: MySQL and PowerBI

I used powerbi for it so these are steps to start
Step 1: Install powerbi desktop form microsoft store 
Step 2: Signup/sign in to your powerbi account
Step 3: Importin the dataset to the powerbi tool
Step 4: Click load if there are no changes but if any data cleaning is needed then click transform data
Step 5: Based upon the needs start creating an interactive dashboard
